And it's important we overcome it as it's effects is capable of hindering us from achieving greatness and harnessing our potential.

**Steps on Overcoming imposter syndrome**
1. **Acknowledge It:**

    The first step I would recommend in overcoming this syndrome, is to 
    Acknowledge it.
   Your ability to acknowledge it helps you to look out for solutions, denying it's existence is no 
   solution to overcoming it.
   To be able to acknowledge it  there is a need for self Audit and self evaluation, this is to help you point 
   out the loopholes that may have inflicted the syndrome.

2. **Ask and seek for Help:**

   This can't be over emphasized, I can't deny how asking for help from senior developers ,mentors, and those who I think are capable of helping me has greatly impacted my life.
    I'd recommend you to ask for help, have conversations with people who have walked your journey, this alone could go a long way in breaking free from imposter syndrome . Also , ask yourself honest questions, this will help you to see clearly where you need to work on and things you need to correct in your habits, character etc.
       
    > Ask for help. Not because you are weak. But because you want to remain strong. *les brown*

3. **Join Communities:**

   Joining a community is a good way to break free from imposter syndrome, especially surrounding 
   yourself with people of like minds who will inspire you, encourage you, and help you get rid of self- 
   doubt and negativity.
 
4. **Own your accomplishments:**

    I know of a lady who has a journal that contains her achievements.

    Own your achievements big or little, celebrate every win.

    So when you go through your achievements, and you remember the efforts you put into your 
   achievements, you'd discard the imposter feeling.

5. **Be a lifelong learner:**

   Engage and invest in yourself, devote time to learning. Be updated on the latest information on your 
  stack. Set a reminder if you have to. This is a good way of overcoming imposter.

6. Lastly, **Put in the work:**

   You can only and most importantly overcome imposter syndrome by deliberately,  intentionally ,and 
  diligently putting in the efforts.
  Making sure you play your part by reading, taking courses, learning about yourself

      >A wise lady once said "You can't know a strength you don't know exists,"

  So when you begin to play your part, discover and harness your strength.
   In no time, you'd be amazed at the new version of yourself

  In conclusion, You are not alone! Imposter syndrome happens to everyone, but the way we handle it is 
  the difference. Choose to handle it differently by breaking its limitations, and don't forget to share your 
  story to everyone, cause someone needs your story to challenge them to overcome it and become    better.

  Take it easy on yourself and take baby steps!
