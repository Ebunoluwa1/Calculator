## Why you should Join Tech.


So, since I was a little child I've always wanted to learn a skill, especially when I see my friends, or close ones, or someone of my age learning a skill, and I'm just there not learning anything. sometimes, I feel bad for myself wondering what to learn and you know looking for where to learn and looking for something that won't cost much too at the same time which is quite difficult.
  But I really didn't know what to do but to wait but I wasn't always happy when I look at myself and realize I really can't boast of any skill.

This continued until I attended a meeting, and someone was called to speak on *technology* and you know that was the only session that actually really got my interest.

And from there I gained admission having had this interest for tech in my heart since I attended that meeting, I'd stop my story here and this would bring me to the reason why I've written this article:


 *Why you should join tech*

1. *It is free*: You need no capital to start tech, I mean for other skills that I know of and I've seen you have to pay money or start with something but with tech it is free .it is available for everyone as long as you're willing or ready.

2. *It is a high-income skill*: It is a skill that gives you high income, you get to earn money as a young individual...you receive high salaries.

3. *Flexibility*: Another reason why you should join technology, is its *flexibility*. so, you can get to work remotely, work the hours that best suit your schedule.

4. *Mentally stimulating work*: since tech jobs are on computers, it involves logical thinking as it'd be required in complicated codes and challenging problems, it also involves creativity to design systems and formulate tests.

5. *Lots of Opportunities*: In technology, there are opportunities for you. so, you can develop a career in technology that perfectly suits your needs, leading to the ultimate goal. GENUINE JOB SATISFACTION.

So, in conclusion, I'd encourage you to CHOOSE TECH. you don't have to worry like I was in the story I shared above or worry about how to do it, or the fact of not having a system as long as you have a smartphone you are good to go, with this- in no time youd be surprised by what you can achieve.

Thank you
