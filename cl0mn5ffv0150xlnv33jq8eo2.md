## The Myths about Imposter Syndrome and Its symptoms

After an experience with imposter syndrome, It feels okay for me to share with you one or two things about it.
I realize there are lots of articles on this topic and its effects can't be overemphasized. It has to be reiterated so we could see how to constantly deal with it, especially in the ever-changing Dev world.

**What is Imposter syndrome?**

In simple terms, Imposter syndrome is the feeling of self-doubt and personal incompetence that persist despite your achievements, experience, exposure, education, and accomplishments.

**Do you know** that despite how far you have come, you can still tend to have this syndrome.

I'd like to say, Imposter syndrome happens to everyone. 

This article will be in two parts, We'd deal with the myths and symptoms of imposter syndrome and the next part will be on How To overcome it.

So let's dive inâ€¦

**Some Myths about Imposter Syndrome**

1.** Imposter syndrome isn't real:**

 It has been researched for years across different fields, and all researchers have come to agree that Imposter syndrome exists.
      So, here is one myth debunked and you must know, Imposter syndrome is real.

2.**Impostor  syndrome only affects women:**

This myth isn't true. This syndrome is common to everyone both male and female, all age groups, and 
   across different fields.
 
Though when it was first researched it was seen to be prevalent in women, after subsequent research it was discovered to affect both men and women.

3.**Imposter syndrome is your fault:**

Many people with this syndrome assume it's their fault for not being smart enough, well experienced, 
       exposed, capable, and good enough.
      But this is false!
      The truth is even intelligent, capable, and well-experienced people experience it.

4.**Imposter syndrome keeps you humble**

 Oh my! This is a big lie. It never keeps you humble but rather miserable( it may cause burnout, mental 
    health problems, overthinking or worrying, etc) and keeps you from reaching your full potential and 
    achieving your goals.

   So if you are using Imposter syndrome as a check to keep you humble, then you need to change that 
   strategy.

   Being able to own your achievements, skills, knowledge, and experience isn't the same as boasting about them

4.**Imposter syndrome is a mental condition**

   A lot of people think something is wrong with them when they experience imposter syndrome, but nothing is wrong with you.
   This is a feeling that comes and goes. It is only present in a certain environment perhaps at work due to its demands, stress and challenges but this may not be at home.
   Imposter syndrome isn't a mental condition, it's a phenomenon, a feeling that can be cured and corrected.

 Now that the myth has been debunked.
