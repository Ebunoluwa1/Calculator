## Seven solid reasons why I think you should join a community?


I hear this question most of the time.

But really, why join a community?
 Why would I recommend this to anyoneâ€¦

Let's dive in to find out.

As a Front end developer, I've seen how belonging to a community of people with like-minds has had a GREAT impact on one's life and journey.

A few years ago, I was still trying to find my footing as regards what to do as an amateur in the dev world, I was ALONE, really alone.
I felt I was placed in the middle of nowhere to go and with no direction whatsoever. But what helped in my Journey was discovering those people who were good in their stack and have gained the mastery, and also gained the right perspective as regards what they wanted to do I introduced myself to them and I expressed my dilemma to them.

So my conversation with them which was virtual at first, and then physical helped me to understand what to do and it gave me clear direction as to the path I want to tread.

Let's get to the bottom of this,

But first, ** what is a community?**

**Merriam-Webster dictionary** defines a * Community as a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society.*
I believe this defines Community. It's a group of like-minded people to help, improve, impact, and transform themselves to become a better version. 

**Benefits of Joining a Community**
 
**Direction and Clarity**
  
From my introduction joining a community gives you an understanding of what you are to do and How to do it. For instance, if you are new to the tech world someone is willing to take you through what you need to know and understand, and through this valuable knowledge you have received, you can navigate yourself and make the right decisions because you now have direction and are clarified from confusion.
You must take note there is lots of information online but not everything is true and in the right order of path. I'm not neglecting the fact there is true information online but hearing from someone who has gone ahead of you helps a whole lot in guiding you.


**Network**

  Being a member of a community provides the opportunity to Networking and connect with like-minded people, mentors, and friends, who would, later on, help build, challenge, and Improve your tech skills either through conversations, mentoring, meetups or hangouts.
 
**The community also creates Access**

  We never know how much we are missing out until you are with the right company. This is what being a member of a community helps to achieve, it gives Access to Mentors, Experts, and Access to Premium advice.

**Exposure**

The range of exposure increases as you join and participate actively in the community. Many times this is always enlightening and mind-opening.

**Innovation and Collaboration**

This can't be overemphasized, joining a community promotes new ideas and unites members to work together to achieve a goal or solve a problem.
This happens with people of common interests, and It promotes interpersonal skills, leadership skills, problem-solving skills, Teamwork skills, e t c in individuals.

**Opportunities**

Joining a Community creates Opportunities and opens up chances for jobs, internships, gigs, etc.

**Sense of Belonging**

This helps every individual and brings about a Creative side in them, and it also boosts one's physical and mental health.
 In addition to the above, being in a community helps you to know you are not alone and this strengthens your resolve to be better and grow progressively.

**In conclusion**, I'd summarize the Benefits of joining a community as a **PLACE FOR IMPACT**, because in the real sense that is the aim of a community.

Thank you for making it this far! And I hope it was a helpful read and I hope it has convinced you to see Community in a better light and you have been encouraged to look out for one to Join.
